# say-hello-greeter

Simple Android app proof of concept. I do a lot in web development but less in mobile so wanted to make this simple project to examine how mobile handles event listeners and updating state based on inputs.

Concepts covered:

- OnClickListeners (Buttons)
- OnTextChangeListeners (EditTexts)
- TextWatchers
- Dynamically enabling/disabling buttons
